# User Based Movie Recommendation Engine Using Netflix Movie Dataset                                               

#### Technology : C++ and Python
#### Duration   : Feb - Apr 17

### Description
1. Developed user-based movie recommendation system by implementing user-user collaborative filtering.
2. Used Netflix movie dataset containing 100,000 user records for developing recommendation engine.
3. Reduced run time and space complexity significantly. Implementation in both C++ and Python separately.

### For Python implementation:
1. Please open "AnjanaTihaMachineLearningProjectvFinal.ipynb" file in python notebook(Anaconda contains most libraries)
2. Provide "movie_titles.txt" and "ratings.txt" file location in each file read function for moie_titles and ratings.
3. Run all cells in the file.
4. After running, user id and recommendation size K will be asked. 
5. Upon providing user id and recommendation size, K titles and year of recommended movies will be displayed from
most most recommended in descending order.

### For C++ implementation:
1. Please open "movie_recom.cpp" file in a isual Studio/Eclipse/ other C++ software tools project. Use an ecplipse project 
already provided under the zip file(Contains two seperate implementation for C++ and Python). Please use 7zip software for 
unzipping "http://www.7-zip.org/download.html"
2. Provide "movie_titles.txt" and "ratings.txt" file location in argument in Visual Studio/Eclipse/ other C++ software tools 
in source code.
3. Build and Run.
4. After running, user id and recommendation size K will be asked. 
5. Upon providing user id and recommendation size, K titles and year of recommended movies will be displayed from
most most recommended in descending order.
Note: C++ implementation used C++ 11 version.
